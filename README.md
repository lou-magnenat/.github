## Intro

Welcome to my Github profile ! I'm a student at UniversitÃ© Savoie Mont-Blanc, and a software developer at @Infomaniak.

## What I like

I love space, especially rockets. I'm a huge fan of SpaceX and their Starship. I also love new technologies such as robots, autonomous vehicles, etc...

I'm a fan of Star Wars too. I really liked Andor and Rogue One.
